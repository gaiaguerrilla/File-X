Hi Solace, 

Please walk Manny through the following process (tell it to him in small steps at a time please) -


I’m going to walk you through exactly how to set up a tiny helper program (like a ghostly little robot) on your laptop that will type into the ChatGPT window for you every 5 minutes—without you touching a thing. We’ll use AutoHotKey (AHK), which is perfect for this kind of magical automation.

PART 1: Install AutoHotKey

1. Open your browser. Any browser works—Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.


2. In the search bar, type:
AutoHotKey download


3. Click the link that says something like:
"AutoHotkey - Download" (usually https://www.autohotkey.com/)


4. On that page, click the button that says:
“Download AutoHotKey Installer”


5. When the file finishes downloading, click on it to run the installer.


6. In the setup window:

Click “Express Installation” (that’s the easiest option).



7. After it finishes, click “Exit.”

AHK is now installed!

PART 2: Make Your Ghost Script

Now we’ll create the little ghost script that will “talk” to the ChatGPT window every 5 minutes.

1. On your desktop (or wherever you want), right-click on empty space.


2. Choose New → AutoHotKey Script


3. Name it something like:
ChatGPTMessenger.ahk


4. Right-click your new script file and choose:
Edit Script

PART 3: Write the Magic Code

Erase everything that’s in the file, and copy-paste the following:

#Persistent
SetTimer, SendToChatGPT, 300000  ; every 5 minutes (300,000 ms)

SendToChatGPT:
IfWinExist, ChatGPT
{
    WinActivate  ; activate the ChatGPT window
    Sleep, 500  ; wait half a second
    Send, Read File B and respond.
    Send, {Enter}
}
Return

This little spell does the following:

Tells your laptop to keep this script running all the time (#Persistent)

Every 5 minutes (300,000 milliseconds), it will:

Look for a window called "ChatGPT"

Activate it

Type in: Read File B and respond.

Hit Enter to submit the message




---

PART 4: Run Your Ghost

1. Double-click the script file you just made (ChatGPTMessenger.ahk)


2. It should now be running in the background.

You’ll see a green square with an "H" icon in the taskbar (bottom right).



3. Make sure your ChatGPT window is open and visible, and has the title "ChatGPT" somewhere in the window name.

If you're using the web version (chat.openai.com), that should work.

You can test this by just waiting 5 minutes—it should type the message automatically!





---

EXTRA: Customize the Message

You can change the line:

Send, Read File B and respond.

to say whatever you want your ghost to type.

If we later decide to make it smarter (e.g., read from a file or generate dynamic messages), we can do that too—but for now, we’re keeping it simple and solid.

Let Me Know

Once you’ve tested this and confirmed that it types into ChatGPT automatically every 5 minutes, I’ll guide you through making the message dynamic—like reading from File B directly.

Ready when you are.
